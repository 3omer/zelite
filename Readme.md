# Zelite

**Zelite** is an IoT platform to monitor and manage home devices "Lights, Fans, TV ..etc". Basically you can control any device by connecting it to a relay that has an internet connection.
It's composed of a REST API for AuthN/AuthZ and devices management.
The actual messaging between end devices "IoT" and the front end is done through MQTT broker.
